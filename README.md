# Vent-Save
Vent &amp; Save was created as part of my submission for Leaving Cert Computer Science Course Work 2022.


# What is Vent & Save
Vent & Save is a fictional company. My aim of creating Vent & Save is to create a company who design a system which optimizes when a vent should be opened or not.
My stsem has various  analouge sensors which work together aswell as an interaction with Google's Firebase to optimize when it should operate the servo (Vent) and turn on the fan
